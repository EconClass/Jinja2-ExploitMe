# Exploit Write Up for Jinja2

For this app we will be leveraging the ability to evalute python expressions in Jinja templates by passing expresions as parameters in a `GET` request to our Flask app.

* Using the double braces allows users to run basic math expressions on the server.  
For example:

  * `sample.url/?exploit={{9*9}}` will be evalueted as `81` on the server.

* Using the following expression, `9|string()` we can typecast the integer `9` as a string `"9"` and multiply it with an integer.  Like so:

  * `sample.url/?exploit={{9|string()*2}}` will ouput: `"99"`

* Can we do the same as above with strings like: `"hello"`?
